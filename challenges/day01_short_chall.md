# CHALLENGE: SHEBANG, INPUT, PRINT, CONCATENATE, VARIABLES

**Objective:** Write a script that contains the following:

1. An input asking the user's name.
2. An input asking what day of the week it is.
3. A print statement that reads:
      
    ```
    Hello, <name>! Happy <day of the week>!
    ```
    
No cheating... print has to use both inputs, and no "hard coding in" your name and the day in your print function :)

**BONUS POINTS:** no white space weirdness in your output!

So nothing like this:

    Hello,Jason!   Happy   monday !
