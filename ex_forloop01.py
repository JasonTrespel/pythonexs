"""creating a basic for loop"""

# a for loop will iterate across all items in a list/dictionary/tuple

# start with a list of pet names
petlist = ["Fluffy", "Garfield", "Snowball", "Olvier"]

# loop across list
for pet in petlist:
    print(petlist)

# loop in a different way
for each in petlist:

# change list to change loop
